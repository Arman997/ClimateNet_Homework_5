# ClimateNet_HomeWork_5 Flask API Project  

## about this project

This is my Python Flask project, where I receive data via an API and send it to the frontend.

- For details on how to set up the server, check out the **[Wiki](../../wiki)**.

  - `Flask`  
  - `render_template`  
  - `jsonify`  
  - `requests`  
  - `json`
